The board is placed, the decks are shuffled for both players and the players are
given a territory on their side of the board to start. Blue player goes first and the red
player goes second. The player going first is given 3 gold tokens for their first move,
and they proceed to draw 3 cards from their deck. The player going second is given
4 gold tokens for their first move and they draw 4 cards from their deck.

Rules

1. The players can play as many cards on their turn as long as they can afford
the gold cost of the cards. As they play their cards, their gold decreases.
2. At the start of each turn, the players gain 3 gold and draw a card from their
deck.
3. Players can play their creatures on their starting block and the adjacent
blocks initially. As they start to occupy more blocks, they can play creatures
to a block as long as a friendly creature is stationed on an adjacent block.
4. Creatures can only move and attack to their adjacent blocks.
5. A creature cannot move or attack on the same turn it is played. It needs to
wait a turn.
6. Charge creatures can attack or move on the same turn they are played.

attack the opponent’s hero with your creature.
8. Player’s can only hold 5 cards in their hands. If they try to draw more cards
while holding 5 cards, a card will be discarded instead.
9. If a player’s deck becomes empty, they will take fatigue damage each turn
starting with 1 and increasing by 1 each turn they try to draw from their
empty deck.
